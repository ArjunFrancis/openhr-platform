## Executive Summary

OpenHR serves four primary user personas: **(1) Technical Co-Founders** seeking business partners (35% of target market), **(2) Business Co-Founders** seeking technical partners (40%), **(3) Founding Engineers** seeking equity opportunities (15%), and **(4) Early-Stage Startups** seeking founding team members (10%). Each persona has distinct motivations, pain points, and success criteria.

**Key Insight**: Technical co-founders prioritize **equity (80%), autonomy (75%), and mission alignment (70%)** over salary. Business co-founders struggle to assess technical depth, relying on proxies like GitHub stars, previous startup experience, and referrals.

## Persona 1: Technical Co-Founder (Seeking Business Partner)

### Demographics
- **Age**: 28-38 years old
- **Location**: Remote-first (60%), SF/NYC/London (40%)
- **Background**: 5-10 years engineering experience, 1-2 previous startups or senior roles at tech companies
- **Technical Skills**: Full-stack (40%), Backend (30%), Mobile (15%), AI/ML (15%)
- **Current Status**: Side project with traction, technical MVP built, needs business leadership

### Goals & Motivations
1. **Primary Goal**: Find business co-founder to handle fundraising, sales, operations, hiring
2. **Equity Target**: 40-50% equity split (willing to negotiate based on complementary skills)
3. **Commitment**: Full-time co-founder (not advisor or part-time consultant)
4. **Timeline**: 3-6 months to find right match, 6-12 months to validate product-market fit
5. **Long-term Vision**: Build venture-scale company, exit via acquisition or IPO

### Pain Points
1. **Assessing Business Acumen**: Hard to evaluate sales ability, fundraising skills, domain expertise from LinkedIn profiles
2. **Commitment Uncertainty**: Many "business co-founders" are only interested part-time or as advisors
3. **Equity Negotiation**: Unclear how to value business vs technical contributions
4. **Network Limitations**: Don't have access to business/product talent networks (limited to engineering circles)
5. **Time Sink**: 20+ coffee chats to find 1 committed co-founder (6-12 months average)

### Success Criteria
- **Immediate Win**: 3-5 high-quality intro conversations per week
- **3-Month Win**: 1-2 serious co-founder candidates (mutual interest, aligned vision)
- **6-Month Win**: Signed co-founder agreement, working together full-time on MVP

- **Current Status**: Validated problem, customer interviews completed, needs technical execution

### Goals & Motivations
1. **Primary Goal**: Find technical co-founder to build MVP and lead engineering team
2. **Equity Target**: 50-60% equity retention (open to equal split for exceptional technical talent)
3. **Commitment**: Full-time co-founder with CTO-level capabilities
4. **Timeline**: 6-12 months to find right technical partner (more selective than hiring engineer)
5. **Long-term Vision**: Scale to Series A/B funding, build enduring company

### Pain Points
1. **Evaluating Technical Depth**: Can't assess code quality, architectural decisions, or technical debt risk
2. **Proxies for Skill**: Rely on GitHub stars, previous company logos, degrees (imperfect signals)
3. **Engineer vs CTO**: Hard to differentiate between "good coder" and "founding CTO who can scale team"
4. **Trust & Chemistry**: Need to assess working style, communication, and decision-making compatibility
5. **Equity Expectations**: Technical co-founders often expect 40-50% equity, which feels high for "later" join

### Success Criteria
- **Immediate Win**: 5-10 technical co-founder intro calls per month
- **3-Month Win**: 2-3 serious candidates (technical assessment passed, vision alignment)
- **6-Month Win**: Co-founder hired, MVP development started (wireframes → functional prototype)

## Persona 3: Founding Engineer (Seeking Equity Opportunity)

### Demographics
- **Age**: 24-32 years old
- **Location**: Remote-first (80%), willing to relocate for right opportunity (20%)

### Goals & Motivations
1. **Primary Goal**: Join early-stage startup (idea to seed stage) with **>1% equity** and meaningful impact
2. **Equity Target**: 0.5-2% for founding engineer role, 5-15% for technical co-founder role
3. **Commitment**: Willing to take pay cut (40-60% below market) for equity upside
4. **Timeline**: 3-6 months to find right opportunity, 12-18 months to vest first equity cliff
5. **Long-term Vision**: Learn startup operations, build network, eventually start own company

### Pain Points
1. **Equity Valuation**: Hard to assess if 1% equity at seed stage is worth $50K pay cut
2. **Vesting Cliffs**: Many startups fail before 12-month cliff, losing all equity
3. **Founder Flakiness**: Founders change direction, abandon projects, or don't commit full-time
4. **Limited Context**: Job descriptions don't show traction, runway, or product-market fit progress
5. **Salary Sacrifice**: Risk of losing 1-2 years of career growth if startup fails

### Success Criteria
