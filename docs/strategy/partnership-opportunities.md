## Executive Summary

OpenHR's fastest path to scale isn't through paid ads—it's through strategic partnerships with existing platforms and organizations that serve founders. By integrating with Y Combinator, Techstars, accelerators, venture platforms, and university entrepreneurship programs, we can reach millions of qualified users without customer acquisition costs. This document outlines 10+ partnership opportunities with implementation details, business models, and success metrics. Each partnership compounds; by month 6, partnerships could account for 40-50% of new user acquisition.

## 7. Monetization Partnership Models

### 7.1 Revenue Share Model

**How it works:**

```
Partner (e.g., YC) features OpenHR
        |
        v
User joins from partner link
        |
        v
User converts to paid tier
        |
        v
OpenHR pays partner 20-30% of subscription revenue
```

**Example:**
- Partner brings 1000 users
- 10% convert to paid ($99/year) = 100 users
- Revenue: $9,900
- Partner gets: $1,980-2,970
- OpenHR keeps: $6,930

### 7.2 Fixed Fee Model

**How it works:**

```
Partner brings users --> OpenHR pays monthly fee ($5K-50K) --> Exclusive integration
```

**Best for:**
- Large platforms (AngelList, Crunchbase)
- Enterprise-level access

### 7.3 Equity Model (Future)

**For strategic partners only:**

```
Partner invests in OpenHR --> Gets equity stake --> Revenue share
```

**Example:** VCs invest $100K for 1% equity + 25% revenue share (while equity owned)
