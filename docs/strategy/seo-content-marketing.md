# SEO & Content Marketing Strategy

**Date Created:** December 13, 2025  
**Status:** Final  
**Audience:** Marketing and Content Teams

---

## Executive Summary

Content marketing is OpenHR's most cost-effective growth channel. Instead of paying $20-30 per user via ads, we can create valuable content that attracts founders and developers organically. This strategy targets high-intent keywords ("How to find a co-founder," "Startup team building," etc) and builds authority through helpful articles, case studies, and tools. Combined with organic SEO optimization, we can capture 20-30% of new users from search and content by month 6, while establishing OpenHR as **the** authority on co-founder matching.

"80% of co-founder breakups happen in the first 2 years.
Most are preventable.

The #1 cause? Not incompatible skills—incompatible values.

When building a startup with someone, align on:
- What 'success' means
- How you handle failure
- Work-life boundaries

The hard talks now = success later."

- How to pitch yourself
- Red flags to watch for

1. Skill fit is table stakes
   - You can learn skills
   - But you can't learn integrity

2. Values must align
   - Define success together
   - Agree on risk tolerance

3. Communication > everything
   - Can you disagree well?
   - Will you have hard conversations?

4. Trial periods work
   - Work together for 2 weeks
   - THEN decide to go all-in"

Post type 2: Company updates
"OpenHR hit 1,000 founders this month. 

We've matched 15 co-founder pairs.

Some updates:
- Added LinkedIn enrichment
- Improved skill matching (now 87% accuracy)
- Built team collaboration features

We're still early. If you're looking for a technical co-founder,
